The Pushcart War by [Jean Merrill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Merrill) is a book about economics in the guise of a children's book.

This is a tale set in New York. Think of the New York of the 1960's when it was written. The city has been growing and is filled with people, cars, taxis, pushcarts, and trucks, lots of trucks. The trucks get pushy and the pushcarts push back. When you read, take care to try not to notice the few sections that are difficult to believe and imagine that the events actually happened, and the book is written to help you. Think of it as the history that was left out of the textbooks for being too exciting.
