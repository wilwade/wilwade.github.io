The Chess Mysteries of the Arabian Knights by [Raymond Smullyan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Smullyan) is a collection of chess puzzles. The Arabian Knights part is really just dressing for the puzzles. This is actually the second of Raymond's chess logic books with [The Chess Mysteries of Sherlock Holmes](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486482014/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=without-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0486482014) being republished in January.

The chess mysteries start out fairly easy, although not for the non-chess player. Several chess rules that are not used by the occasional player are referenced such as [en passant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant). I suggest on the early puzzles to give up early and read the answers (that are given in the back of the book), so that you can get a feel for the logic.

And remember there really is only one possible answer.

Note: There are currently only used copies for sale on Amazon, but your local library might also have a copy that you could request.
