The Physics of Star Trek by [Lawrence Krauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_M._Krauss) reviews the reality of the imagination in Star Trek. Warp drives and holodecks are all looked into from the light of current physics.

Although now a bit dated to current physics,The Physics of Star Trek is a great read for both pop-science and tremors. The author works hard to explain complex physics through Star Trek and does a great job. If you do not understand physics,this is an enjoyable way to learn. The book focuses mostly on The Next Generation as there is a lot more science imagined in that series than The Original Series. I have also read the sequel: [The Biology of Star Trek](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060929243/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=without-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0060929243), but it is not quite as exciting as physics.

*You might like it if...*
 * You like science fiction and science.
 * You enjoy Star Trek and want to learn for about physics.

Buy it on Amazon (Revised Edition. I read non-revised.): [The Physics of Star Trek](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465002048/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=without-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0465002048)
