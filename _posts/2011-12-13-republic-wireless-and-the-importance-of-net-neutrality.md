Republic Wireless ([republicwireless.com](https://www.republicwireless.com)) is a new cell service company that is in limited beta. It is dirt cheap at $19 a month for unlimited service (*Update 2014:* They now have a range of plans from $5-$40, but all quite nice.). The big catch (or if you are like me benefit) to it is that it wants your data to run mostly off of WiFi connections instead of the backup cell network.

All of the top Internet Service Providers in the United States have a stake in either television or phone service and often both. Until now internet telephone services had been limited in the number of users, and never had been in danger of replacing mobile phones. Television services like Netflix, or Amazon's Video on Demand have been around for a while, but that only challenged the ISPs who also provided television services.

Now every major ISP increasing is experiencing conflict internally. One area, Internet service, is increasingly competing with other areas and the money is not flowing internally, but bleeding out of the company. With both television and now telephone services increasing provided via the Internet by other companies, it is in the best interest of the major ISPs, although not consumers, to throw Net Neutrality out the window.
