The Encyclopedia of Herbs, Spices, & Flavorings by [Elisabeth Lambert Ortiz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Lambert_Ortiz) is the first real reference book I have reviewed thus far. It covers all the basics and gives that bit extra that makes it still worth keeping even if Wikipedia is in your pocket.

I enjoy learning about spices, discovering spices and new spice combinations. Often I feel that I am shooting in the dark. This book not only tells you about the herbs and spices, but gives common combinations and different forms. There are even tips about if it is better fresh or dried. Not to mention some wonderful photos of the stuff. I do not like some of the choices in how the items are ordered in the book making it harder to find items than you might think, but it makes a great addition to the cook book shelf.

*You might like it if...*
 * You like to experiment while cooking.
 * You have/want to have an herb garden, and need ideas on use.
 * You want to expand your spice pallet.

The Weekly Book Review is seen here every week. The reviews are of books off of my own shelf, and limited in length.
