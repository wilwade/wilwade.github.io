Confederate Agent by James D. Horan recounts the history of the Confederate spies and rogues, mostly in the mid-western states and the tale of the Northwest Conspiracy. Mostly following the exploits of [Thomas Hines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hines), and [John Hunt Morgan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hunt_Morgan).

The book is historically accurate, but is written in the narrative form, building as story that engages and flows. I did not know that much about covert Civil War operations, and had not heard anything about the attacks on New York in 1864, or the capture of a ship by Confederates on the Great Lakes. Although published in 1954, the narrative tone sets this history above others as both a great read and great history.

Note: There are currently only used copies for sale on Amazon, but your local library might also have a copy that you could request.
