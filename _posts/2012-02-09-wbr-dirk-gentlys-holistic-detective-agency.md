Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency by [Douglas Adams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams) is one of Adams' less known books, but I think it is one of his best.

This is a twisted tale that might take more than one reading to understand. Still it is great science fiction, detective, and humor all wrapped up in one. Not much else can be said without spoilers so remember that it is not easy to follow, but it is enjoyable if you try to enjoy the read and be surprised.

*You might like it if...*
 * You like Douglas Adams.
 * You like stories that are super confusing.
 * You want to expand your mind.
 * You believe in the interconnectedness of all things
