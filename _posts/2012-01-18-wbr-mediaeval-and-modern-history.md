Mediaeval and Modern History by Philip Van Ness Myers is not your normal history book that you wil find in a book store. The main reason being that it was published in 1905. Old textbooks are often discarded, but I find old history books off an excellent lesson in how time changes perspective on events.

This history ends at a very interesting point. The Russo-Japanese War was just about to end. World War I was not even thought of, and all appeared to point to a new era of peace.There is even talk of a United States of Europe and greater European unity. Of course it will take two massive wars and about a hundred years for that to happen.

Note: There are currently only used copies for sale on Amazon, but your local library might also have a copy that you could request.
