China: A New History is a short history of China, pre-history to today. An overview thousands of years of history condensed into under 500 pages.

Eastern history is unforgivably ignored in the standard teaching in American schools and colleges. Here is a book to help solve that problem. China: A New History can be read, and I suggest it, without need to remember very many of the many names thrown about in the history. When read trying to keep the big picture in mind, you can gain some feel for the ideals and history behind events in the world today.

*You might like it if...*
 * You enjoy history.
 * You want to understand modern geopolitics better.
 * You think you missed something in college when you only took Western Civilization and there was no Eastern Civilization.

Buy it on Amazon (one edition newer than I have): [China: A New History, Second Enlarged Edition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674018281/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=without-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0674018281)
