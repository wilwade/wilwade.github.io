Git is a piece of version control software that is used on projects big and small. The largest project is likely the Linux Kernel. Git can be downloaded from [git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com).

Git however is a rather difficult system to wrap your mind around, mostly because it is so powerful. Often with great power comes great complexity, or at least more of it. (Hmm... an AK-47 is really simple, yet powerful. Perhaps that is why it is so popular and Git is not? Of course not everyone needs a version control system...) Today thanks to a post on my local PHP Users Group, I found an easy way to learn Git in more depth and a great way to teach others.

It has a wonderful walk through of Git in 50 "labs." Covering basic usage, to some more advanced concepts. I wish I had known about this 7 months ago when I started using Git for my own projects.
